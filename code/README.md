# Project Name

Project Guess who
Make the guess who game to work with the help of java script-


## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

When I saw the project and the code, I was overwhelmed. I did not understand at all where to start or how to solve it. But we have had a great week in the team where we have all been helped each other to solve the assignment. Without my team, I would never have been able to solve it myself. My goal this week was to just try to understand how the java script works, and what to do with it. And I think I understand a little more than last week. It would have been fun if I had had more time to exchange the pictures and make the game more "mine". But I do not think I could have done more this week, I am happy to just understand a little better.
